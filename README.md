*Dribbling ability significantly predicts finishing performance, while heading accuracy,
crossing, and ball control also play crucial roles in soccer skill development*

This memo presents an analysis of the relationship between finishing ability and key football attributes—dribbling, head accuracy, ball control, and crossing—among players from the top six English Premier League clubs. Understanding how these skills influence finishing is crucial for optimizing player performance and development in one of the most competitive football leagues. Using Multiple Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression with a significance level of 0.05, this analysis aims to provide insights for coaches, scouts, and team managers. The Null Hypothesis (H₀) states that there is no relationship between these player attributes and finishing ability, while the Alternative Hypothesis (H₁) suggests that these attributes are related to finishing. ● The independent variables (IVs) in this analysis are the football attributes—dribbling, head accuracy, ball control, and crossing—which represent key skills that may influence a player's finishing ability. Each of these attributes is measured as a rating based on player performance. ● The dependent variable (DV) is finishing, which reflects a player’s ability to convert chances into goals. This analysis aims to determine how these individual skills contribute to finishing ability among players in the top six English Premier League clubs Heading Accuracy shows a slightly left-skewed distribution, meaning that more players have high heading accuracy. The range is large, suggesting variability in heading ability among players.Crossing also displays a moderate left-skew, with a notable concentration of players having crossing abilities above the mean.This could suggest that many players on these top Premier League teams possess above-average crossing skills, which may be valuable for assisting in goal-scoring situations.Dribbling is more heavily left-skewed, indicating a Table 2: Quantitative Summary Freq Min Max Med.

substantial number of players with dribbling abilities much higher than the mean, suggesting that elite dribbling skills are common among these top-tier players.Similar to dribbling, Ball Control shows a strong left-skew, meaning most players have high ball control scores The ability to control the ball is critical for Premier League-level players.Finding: Finishing ability shows a relatively balanced distribution with only slight skewness. This suggests that finishing skills are more evenly spread across players, and the variance indicates a wide range of abilities in converting chances into goals.All assumptions for the multiple OLS regression are except for the multicollinearity which is high for the dribbling and ball control.No action has been taken as these variables are essential for our analysis.The regression model was specified as follows.
Finishing = -4.918 - 0.123 *Heading Accuracy - 0.107*Crossing + 0.865*Dribbling + 0.216*Ball Control +ε The two variables in the model were statistically significant. Dribbling was highly significant (p < 0.001), while Heading Accuracy was significant at p = 0.0108. Crossing and Ball Control were not statistically significant, with p-values of 0.2407 and 0.1444, respectively.The overall model was statistically significant, as indicated by the F-statistic of 186.7 and a p-value of less than 2.2e-16. This suggests that the model explains a significant portion of the variation in finishing ability.I can reject the null hypothesis (H0) that all regression coefficients are equal to zero since the model was statistically significant. However, not all IVs contributed equally to the model. While some variables like Dribbling and Heading Accuracy showed significant effects, Crossing and Ball Control did not. Generalization to the target population is reasonable, given that the model explains 76.6% of the variance in finishing ability (Adjusted R² = 0.766). However, further validation in different datasets is recommended before making conclusive generalizations.The findings were substantively significant, especially with regard to Dribbling, which had a strong, positive relationship with finishing ability (Estimate = 0.865). This indicates that improvements in dribbling are likely to have a large and meaningful impact on a player's ability to finish. ● Heading Accuracy (-0.123): For every unit increase in heading accuracy, the model predicts a decrease in finishing ability by 0.123, holding all else constant. This negative relationship is statistically significant but small in effect. ● Crossing (-0.107): Crossing has a small negative coefficient but is not statistically significant, indicating no strong effect on finishing ability in this sample.
● Dribbling (0.865): Dribbling has a large positive effect, with each unit increase in dribbling associated with a 0.865 increase in finishing ability. This variable is highly significant and meaningful. ● Ball Control (0.216): Ball control shows a positive coefficient but is not statistically significant, suggesting no conclusive effect on finishing ability. The Dribbling coefficient is highly meaningful both statistically and substantively, as it indicates a strong positive effect on finishing ability. Heading Accuracy is meaningful due to its statistical significance but the effect is modest and negative. The coefficients for Crossing and Ball Control are not meaningful, as they lack statistical significance and thus do not provide strong evidence of an effect on finishing ability.The Adjusted R² of 0.766 indicates that 76.6% of the variance in finishing ability is explained by the independent variables in the model. This is a strong level of explained variance, suggesting that the model fits the data well and that the predictors, especially Dribbling, are important for predicting finishing ability.To calculate the power, we would compute the f² statistic.A high f² value like 3.27 suggests that the model has substantial power, meaning it is likely to detect significant effects when they are present. The overall power of the model is strong, supporting the robustness of the findings. Potential weaknesses in the study include the lack of significance for some variables, such as Crossing and Ball Control, which may suggest omitted variables that better explain finishing ability. Additionally, while the model explains a large portion of the variance, further testing with different samples or across different leagues and player types would strengthen the generalizability of the findings. Moreover, interaction terms or non-linear effects might be explored to see if these factors provide additional insights into finishing ability. In conclusion, the analysis demonstrates that dribbling significantly influences finishing ability, suggesting a targeted focus on improving this skill for enhanced performance in soccer players.For future analyses, recommendation is made to include more nuanced player attributes (e.g., speed, vision, positioning) or considering interaction effects between variables could offer a more complete picture of what influences finishing ability. Additionally, collecting data from a larger or more varied population could enhance the model’s generalizability
